This is (will be) a tutorial on programming for the GNOME platform 
using GTK+3 [www.gtk.org] in Vala [live.gnome.org/Vala]. It will be 
modelled closely after the popular GTK+2.0 tutorial that can be found 
at http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/, whose content I will
try to stay as close to as possible, but try to err on the side of 
explaining too much. It will also try to cover newer features of GTK+ 
3.0 that were not in GTK+2.

It will not assume any deep knowledge of the Vala programming language
or GTK+ programming.

This repository will (ultimately) have a HTML archive of the tutorial,
working code examples and dvi, pdf and ps files.
