This is (will be) a tutorial on programming for the GNOME platform 
using GTK+3 [www.gtk.org] in Vala [https://live.gnome.org/Vala]. It 
will be written to loosely follow the popular GTK+2.0 tutorial that 
can be found at http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/.  

It will not assume any deep knowledge of the Vala programming language
or GTK+ programming.
