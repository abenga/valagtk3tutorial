This is (will be) a tutorial on programming for the GNOME platform 
using GTK+3 [www.gtk.org] in Vala [https://live.gnome.org/Vala]. It 
will be written to closely follow the popular GTK+2.0 tutorial that 
can be found at http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/. I will try
to stay as close to as possible to this tutorial's content, but also 
explain newer features introduced in GTK+3.0.

It will not assume any deep knowledge of the Vala programming language
or GTK+ programming.

This repository will (ultimately) have a HTML archive of the tutorial,
working code examples and dvi, pdf and ps files.
