This is (will be) a tutorial on programming for the GNOME platform 
using GTK+3 [www.gtk.org] in Vala [live.gnome.org/Vala]. It will be 
modelled closely after the popular GTK+2.0 tutorial that can be found 
at http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/, whose content I will
try to stay as close as possible, but possibly erring on the side of 
explaining too much, and will also try to cover newer features of GTK+ 
that came with 3.0.

It will not assume any deep knowledge of the Vala programming language
or GTK+ techniques.

This repository will (ultimately) have a HTML archive of the tutorial,
latex files, and working code examples.
