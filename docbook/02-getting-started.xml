<title>Getting Started</title>

<sect1>

  <title>Installation</title>

  <para>Before we can begin programming, we need to install GTK and Vala, 
  along with their dependencies.</para>

  <sect2>

    <title>Installing GTK+.</title>

    <para>You may install GTK+ and its various dependencies from source by 
        downloading several archives, untarring them and running 
        <command>./configure</command>, <command>./make</command> and 
        <command>./make</command> to install them.</para>
    <para>However, if you're using a Linux distribution with a package manager, 
        it is better to install the precompiled packages from the distribution's 
        repositories as it would be easier and afterward, the packages would 
        receive security updates and any other upgrades as they are rolled out 
        by the distribution.</para>
    <para>You need to install the <filename>-dev</filename> packages that contain 
        the header files and static libraries that are needed to compile GTK+ 
        applications. Installing the GTK+ development package will also install 
        all its dependecies (the header files for <application>GLib</application>, 
        <application>gdk-pixbuf</application>, etc).</para>
    
    <para>On Debian and its derivatives, the command to do this would be:</para>

<screen>
    <prompt>#</prompt><userinput> apt-get install libgtk-3-dev</userinput>
</screen>

    <para>On Fedora, it would be:</para>

<screen>
    <prompt>#</prompt><userinput> yum install libgtk-3-dev</userinput>
</screen>

    <para>You may also use your distribution's graphical software management 
    tools like the Ubuntu Software Centre or Synaptic.</para>
  
  </sect2>

    <title>Installing Vala</title>

    <para>You may install Vala by building from source. First, one obtains 
    the vala source code by downloading a tarball from the vala releases page 
    (<ulink type="http" url="http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Release">
      http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Release
    </ulink>) and extracting it and running <command>./configure</command>, 
    <command>make</command> and <command>make install</command> in the source 
    folder.</para>
    <para>Alternatively, you may install vala from your distribution's 
    repositories.</para>
    <para>On Debian and its derivatives, you would run:</para>

<screen>
    <prompt>#</prompt><userinput> apt-get install valac</userinput>
</screen>

    <para>And on Fedora, one would run:</para>

<screen>
    <prompt>#</prompt><userinput> yum install valac</userinput>
</screen>

    <para>You may also use your distribution's graphical software management 
    tools like the Ubuntu Software Centre or Synaptic.</para>
