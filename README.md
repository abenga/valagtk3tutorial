This is an introductory tutorial on programming for the GNOME platform using
[GTK+3](http://www.gtk.org) in [Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala). It is based
on and will closely follow the popular
[GTK+2.0 tutorial](http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/) written by
Tony Gale, Ian Main, and the GTK team.

Chapters from this tutorial can be read as articles on my personal website at
[abenga.com](http://www.abenga.com/postseries/introduction-to-gtk+-programming-using-vala/).
