This is (or at least, will be when completed) an introductory tutorial
on programming for the GNOME platform using [GTK+3](www.gtk.org) in
[Vala](https://live.gnome.org/Vala). It is based on and will closely
follow the popular [GTK+2.0 tutorial](http://developer.gnome.org/gtk-tutorial/2.90/)
written by Tony Gale, Ian Main, and the GTK team.
